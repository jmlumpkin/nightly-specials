Nightly Specials

A dark theme for various text editors and IDEs. 

Based on the '[Douce nuit trois](http://attaboy.tumblr.com/post/75614496/i-never-thought-about-sharing-my-colours-for)' theme for [BBEdit 10](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) by Luke Andrews, and the [Specials Board](http://joebergantine.com/werkstatt/seestyle) theme for [Coda 2](http://www.panic.com/coda/), as well as the new dark theme for Visual Studio 2012. I liked features from all three, and decided to make my own, slightly simpler theme for some of the various editors I use.
